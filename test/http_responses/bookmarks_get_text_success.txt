<p>In the digital, interactive and social media-focused agency
world, it’s easy to talk a big game, but for disciplines that
require true, deep knowledge of the subject for success,
there’s a fine line between “understanding” and
“expertise”. Our Creative Technology Director Igor
Clark explains why ideas aren’t enough, below the jump.</p>
<p><br />
By Igor Clark, Creative Technology Director</p>
<p>I’ve pretty much had it with the term “Creative
Technology”. I’m a “Creative Technology
Director” myself, and even I’m over it: already it
seems clichéd at best, and at worst, bordering on the
meaningless. Here’s why.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, the rise and rise of “digital”
meant agencies having to come up with increasing amounts of
interactive work. They didn’t know how to do it, so their
developers got screwed, and the work suffered. Horribly.</p>
<p>Few outside the tech teams grasped what was involved in building
the software needed for digital campaigns. Crazy deadlines,
unrealistic expectations, ill-considered and even ill-advised
requirements led to ever-more “inventive” technical
solutions. Then, when the last-minute hack they had to cobble
together failed to stand up to the traffic they never promised it
would, developers were cursed and vilified.</p>
<p>But this wasn’t the really bad part. Software folk who
found their way into agency-land either loved it, and stayed
– or they didn’t, and left. For the ones who stuck
around, and who felt the pain most acutely, the really bad part
wasn’t the pressure or the deadlines: it was that their work
wasn’t understood, so it wasn’t properly
recognized.</p>
<p>Their work wasn’t purely science or technology; though
grounded in both, it was far from the simple application of
formulae or solving of equations. Developers knew that you
couldn’t take a creative brief as a set of instructions and
just “translate” it into software. You have to
interpret it, and that takes an extra spark. A creative spark. They
saw this was a fundamental part of the overall interactive creative
process, and yet a parallel, creative process of its own. The
naming perpetuated the misunderstanding, and so it had to
change.</p>
<p>At the same time, people across agencies were recognizing that
their existing creative model just wasn’t working out for
“interactive”. Crews outside the fortress walls were
doing innovative and engaging work, not only through using new and
different technologies to do it (openFrameworks, Processing, robots
and Arduino, computer vision &amp; Kinect, projection mapping, the
list goes on), but also by trying out different approaches and
processes. Namely: the technology was the creative.</p>
<p><img title="102011kinect" src="http://blog.wk.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/102011kinect.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><em><small>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/maveric2003/5810664761/sizes/z/in/photostream/">
maveric2003</a>, licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">Creative
Commons</a></small></em></p>
<p>In this way, “creative technology” was born: partly
to assuage the accumulating angst of downtrodden developers; partly
to enable those developers willing to step up to the creative plate
also to step outside the conventional development toolkit; and
partly – perhaps most importantly – to spread awareness
across the board that where interactive work is concerned, creating
involves making; making interactive stuff involves technology; and
people can be creative in a range of disciplines, not only blue-sky
ideation.</p>
<p>At its inception, this was A Good Thing, and it happened for
Good Reasons. So what happened? Why do I now find myself wondering
whether Creative Technology, as a label and a discipline, is
effectively bankrupt?</p>
<p>As in any new, burgeoning and (to many) incomprehensible field,
most people have neither the background nor the time to get under
the surface and really understand what it’s all about. So
they need people to help do that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in any field requiring background and time to get
beneath the surface, the ninja dust is easy to throw in the faces
of the uninitiated, disguising the underlying truth – which
is, all too frequently, only a surface-level familiarity with the
necessary materials.</p>
<p>University and training courses spring up, servicing the new
market of people wanting to get educated in the new field. Courses
need funding; funding requires admissions; admissions policies get
broadened; broad admissions policies welcome novices and amateurs.
Ergo, disciplines become ill-disciplined, specialization becomes
flabby and watered-down to the point of meaninglessness.</p>
<p>Outcome: “creative technologists” who think that
their daily use of social media, “passion for digital”
and pile of half-baked ideas about QR codes, mobile integration and
Facebook apps constitute an entitlement to have those ideas brought
to life by the still-downtrodden developers, still languishing in
the dungeons of overworked production companies and in-house
development teams.</p>
<p><img title="102011code2" src="http://blog.wk.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/102011code2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><em><small>Photo by <a href="http://twitter.com/igorclark/">Igor
Clark</a></small></em></p>
<p>As a result, “Creative Technology” has become
watered down to the point where people fresh out of “creative
tech” courses need only sprinkle some of that digital
ninja-dust on their resumés, and those without the requisite
background, know-how and experience to sort the wheat from the
chaff are none the wiser.</p>
<p>The talent drifts off. The ninjas plan and conceive the work,
and analyse its success, using metrics no-one else understands. Bad
work proliferates, becomes accepted and normalized within the
industry; the really good people get further alienated, more dust
is thrown to disguise others taking their places, and round and
round it goes, until no-one knows who’s a ninja and
who’s not. Except for the best people, who’ve left the
agency scene in the dust – and the audience, of course, who
are left unmoved. Or, worse, switched off.</p>
<p>Is this pattern inevitable? Can we, as agency-land
technologists, do anything about it?</p>
<p>Clearly many non-technical factors are involved, but there is
one simple and concrete thing we can do: stop hiring
“creative technologists”. Hire coders. Reject
compromise on this front, and resist pressure to give in to it.
Only hire people to work at the crossover of creative and
technology if they have strong, practical, current coding
skills.</p>
<p>Don’t fall for the illusion that a candidate is creatively
strong enough to compensate for the weak code. Spending a year or
two on a training course gaining a passing acquaintance with a
couple of trending technologies isn’t good enough. They need
to live and breathe this stuff, and to use the appropriate
languages and tools fluently and transparently, without stopping to
think about it. So if a person puts “creative
technologist” on their resumé, but doesn’t know
how to code, can’t show you things they’ve made, and
can’t prove they made them by explaining why they wrote the
code the way they did, don’t hire them. Simple as that.</p>
<p>Think this sounds elitist? Well, it is – and there’s
a reason.</p>
<p><img title="102011pages" src="http://blog.wk.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/102011pages.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><em><small>Photo by <a href="http://twitter.com/igorclark/">Igor
Clark</a></small></em></p>
<p>Agencies don’t hire writers just because they know the
rules of grammar. We hire them because they’re eloquent,
lucid, imaginative wordsmiths. We hire them because of their
practised ability to lovingly craft words into things that work.
Things that make people feel.</p>
<p>There are people who engineer excellent software. There are
people who come up with amazing ideas. The interactive space by
definition requires the fusion of the two, and technology at the
heart of creation. At the point of intersection, you’re going
to need people who understand both, and who have one foot on either
side. As Forrester’s Mike Gualtieri recently wrote in
<a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/11-10-12-agile_software_is_a_cop_out_heres_whats_next">
a fresh piece about how to create great software</a>, that means
“renaissance developers who have passion, creativity,
discipline, domain knowledge, and user empathy”.</p>
<p>This is difficult territory for creative agencies. Maybe you
don’t know how to hire these people yet. Maybe it
doesn’t fit with your structures. Tough, isn’t it? But
you’re going to have to deal with it, and fix it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, to do that you need to provide an environment
that’s as appealing and satisfying for extraordinary,
creative software people as the one you already provide is for
traditional creative folks. But it also needs to be as appealing to
this new breed as their potential alternate settings at Google,
Facebook, Tech Startup X. Fortunately, you have the potential to
make it even more so for genuine creative coders – because
they’re not looking for pure engineering any more than you
are.</p>
<p>While you don’t need to become an engineering company, you
face some of their challenges. You need to understand, accept and
embrace some of the nuts and bolts of software development, and
take on board the work dedicated shops are doing on its processes.
You need such a strong streak of code running through the
atmosphere that coders want to come to you, and everyone else gets
code spilling over them.</p>
<p>But “digital” is a hybrid realm, and you need to
provide a balance. Fortunately, you’re in a perfect position
to counterpoint the engineering-first environment that others have
so successfully developed, leading so successfully to technically
excellent, efficient, and often creatively uninspiring work. You
have the creative angle covered (right?), so to get to the hybrid
middle-ground, you have to allow developers the flexibility, the
leeway and the time to engineer solid work – and you have to
welcome the hybrid creative coders into the heart of what you do,
to make a hybrid place where they feel at home, and where they can
help ensure that what gets sold makes sense, and that it can be
made without actually killing a team of engineers in the
attempt.</p>
<p><img title="102011comment" src="http://blog.wk.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/102011comment.jpg" alt="" /></p>

Clark</a></small></em></p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, this is hard, and it’ll take
time. It’s not just procedural, but cultural, so a big part
of doing it comes down to who you hire and how you let them do
their thing. But that’s exactly the point. That’s why
it’s most important, way before you get all that fixed, and
as the first major step on that road: just don’t hire
“creative technologists” who aren’t strong
coders.</p>
<p>Bottom line, these people need to make stuff, fast. They need to
prove or disprove concepts, in ways that non-technologists
understand, fast. So they need to know how to code efficiently,
economically and effectively. They need to understand the
appropriate technology stack from top to bottom, know which tools
are right for the job – and most of all, they must be
prepared to crack their knuckles, roll up their sleeves and get
their fingers into the code. Up to the elbows.</p>
<p>You’re probably thinking, “OK, those people are few
and far between; we still need people to bridge the gap between
them and the rest of the agency”. You’re not wrong;
you’ve put your finger straight on the really interesting
corollary, and the exact reason why creative agencies could be the
most inspiring environment for creative coders, which is simply
this: we have to be.</p>
<p>With integrated interactive work ever more critical, creative
agencies need to change drastically, in ways that suit perfectly
those people we most need to attract. We need to adapt and evolve
to survive. The serious talent is doing it for itself; going to
small shops, shooting solo. To reach the very best people, we need
to change in ways that make them want to come to us; to allow and
even help them to change us, and to help us shape our
evolution.</p>
<p><img title="102011code1" src="http://blog.wk.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/102011code1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><em><small>Photo by <a href="http://twitter.com/igorclark/">Igor
Clark</a></small></em></p>
<p>This is more than “building a digital team”, or
“covering digital bases”. The agency as a whole has to
step up to the tectonic plate and realize that not only are
digital, social, interactive, gaming all here to stay, but they
already permeate the entire landscape of what consumers are doing.
We need to change our processes, structures and approach to how we
create in order to accommodate this stuff, and open our arms to the
people who make it happen.</p>
<p>Start off by refusing to believe people who tell you that hiring
them to do the understanding for you means you can carry on as you
were. Instead, hire the right people in the right places, and make
the changes necessary to let them do what they do. Creative people
who can code up a storm, and, critically, experienced people who
can properly assess the code they’re shown. These are the
people who will help us flourish – if we can help them to do
the same.</p>
<p>At W+K we’re always looking to meet good technology
people, and we want to read your code. Developers, engineers,
creative coders. If that’s you, if you’ve got the
endurance to make it this far, and if you’re interested in
applying your creativity through code with us in Portland, then why
not <a href="http://www.wk.com/jobs/portland/technology">get in
